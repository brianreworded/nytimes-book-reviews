Tech stack used: Next.js, Prisma, Supabase, NodeJS


Username for website: username

Password: password



How I approached the project:


- I decided to use the New York Times books API, and I focused on the section dedicated to book reviews. Due to my tech stack, and given that the pages are password protected, I didn't include a username/password for the API. To add the feature, I could add a necessary username/password in the search engine form to access results.

- I focused on trying to get everything to work properly, rather than the design. If you want to see more of my website design intuition, you can see reworded.io or reduction.ai

- I thought it made sense to format results in a table. This concept made it turn into a project that was made mostly for one person than in a social media type of setting. For these reasons, you can add comments or a rating, but they are merged, and you cannot add more than one comment -- that comment will merge on its own. 

- The Create and Update functions are found on the homepage. The Delete function is found in the other link, a place where you can look at your own feedback.
